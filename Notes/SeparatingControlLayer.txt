Create "Enemy" (capsule) and prefab ()
On click walk to enemy and start hacking
Organization of scripts -- Movement script + Player Controller (control layer)
Player controller drives movement and combat
Can be swapped out for enemy controller (sep. of concerns)
Movement class -- interface = move to destination
Create MoveTo(Vector3) as public in a Mover class
PlayerController will call MoveTo now (Control script) and do the raycast
