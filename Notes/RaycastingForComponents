Goal -- clicking on enemy capsule produces message
We want to add combat component that is activated by clicking on enemy
Fighter.cs (in RPG.Combat)
public void Attack w/ log message currently
CombatTarget.cs (RPG.Combat) -- placeholder for enemy capsule

Currently PlayerController is only doing movement stuff -- we should extra this to InteractWithMovement
Then add InteractWithCombat
    raycast -- but what if the capsule is behind a tree? We should still attack it...
    Physics.RaycastAll (list of hit results)
    input is the same ray from cursor (from GetMouseRay method)
    foreach to see if any hit got the enemy
        Fighter.Attack if you find a CombatTarget
        GetComponent<CombatTarget> (add namespace)
            notice controller is getting heavier!
        call attack (add CombatTarget arg) if the mouse button is down
