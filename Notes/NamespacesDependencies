Use namespaces to manage dependencies
Dependent scripts need to change if the scripts they depend on change
Avoid cycles where A depends on B depends on C depends on
    Cycles can affect everything in the cycle
Layering to avoid cycles (higher layers depend on lower layers) -- the leaves are most stable
Cohesion -- how much different elements relate to each other in a namespaces
    Greater cohesion at cost of complexity
Put PlayerController in RPG.Control namespace
FollowCamera -- RPG.Core
Mover -- RPG.Movement
control module will use movement module (dependency)
