Attack should take priority over Move
Cursor affordance (cursor shows whether we will attack or move)
Undesirable: moving to capsule when trying to attack
    one comes right after another in update
Solution: one Interact method tells us whether it succeeded and if so we don't go to the next
bool InteractWith
return early or continue with chain
InteractWithCombat will return true if it finds a combat target at all (whether we clicked or not)
otherwise return false
Also do for InteractWithMove (if we clicked somewhere that is not on the world e.g.)
How do we do this checking whether the mouse button is held down?
    put it in MoveToCursor
    calls MoveTo and returns true (we return true if there's a raycast hit)
